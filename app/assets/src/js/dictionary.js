        en: "Numerous diseases in the gastrointestinal tract require surgical procedures in which parts of the intestine are resected (cut off) and joined together again. One such disease is cancer in the large intestine. A majority of all colorectal cancers are treated by surgery. Colorectal cancer surgery is always time consuming and, if the anastomosis needs to be formed in the lower pelvic area, it is also very difficult for the surgeon to get sufficient access for suturing the intestine together. One third of these cases, so-called low resections, are in the lower pelvic area where surgeons need to anastomose the colon to the rectum. The anatomical difficulties have brought forward new procedures. More than half a century ago (1964) the circular stapling instrument was introduced. This was the start of a new era in the possibilities of anastomosing the colon to the rectum. The circular stapling instrument has been refined and improved since its introduction but the basic principles for the instrument remain. The use of the circular stapler for anastomosis after low resections has been the established surgical procedure for the last 45 years. Although the stapling technique is a common procedure it is associated with certain problems."

        en: "The most severe problem of the stapling technique is of course anastomotic leakage. As a consequence, many clinicians routinely create a protective stoma proximal to the anastomosis. This stoma may be temporary or permanent depending on the condition of the patient. Anyhow, this forces the patient not only to endure a stoma for a certain period of time but also requires a reoperation when the stoma is put down again. This implies a new anastomosis with a renewed risk for leakage. Furthermore, convincing data shows that radiotherapy before surgery will decrease local reoccurrence and increase the 5-year survival, but radiotherapy also makes the remaining tissue more vulnerable and less supportive to healing. It is highly understandably that the majority of patients want to avoid a permanent stoma and a majority of patients prefer radiotherapy before surgery. To implement these requirements most developed markets start the treatment of rectal cancer patients with radiotherapy 6-8 weeks before surgery and during surgery use staplers to create an anastomosis and a temporary protective stoma at the level of the small intestine in order to reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage. Due to this established method 80-90% of all low rectal cancer patients will get a temporary stoma. In spite of this precaution with a stoma around 10% of the patients with a stapled anastomosis will develop a leakage and require additional treatment on the ward or the intensive care unit. Moreover, most of the patients with a temporary stoma will undergo surgery again within 2-4 months in order to close the stoma."

The area where the healing process takes place (5) is separated from the area where the necrosis starts (4) i.e. the part of the intestine that is squeezed between the silicone (6) rings and the rigid rings (2). The intestinal ends are only adapted to each other as a consequence of the constant distance created by the rigid rings. The blood flow in the intestinal wall in the area where the healing takes place (5) is consequently not affected by compression due to the distance between the rigid rings.
